# ProofRail Silver Tools

This directory contains tooling for ProofRail Minimal Silver signed bundle assertions.

## Current supported schemas

- Silver Signed Bundle Assertion v0.1.0

## Demo Issuer Generator

Generates a demo Ed25519 keypair and a local verifier trust policy.

```bash
python3 tools/silver/generate_demo_issuer_v0_1_0.py demos/silver-demo-001
python3 tools/silver/generate_demo_issuer_v0_1_0.py demos/silver-demo-001 --force
```

Generated files (runtime-only, not committed):

```
demos/silver-demo-001/runtime/issuer-a/private-key.pem
demos/silver-demo-001/runtime/issuer-a/public-key.pem
demos/silver-demo-001/runtime/verifier-b/trust-policy.yaml
```

The `--force` flag overwrites an existing keypair. Private keys are set to `0600` permissions.

## Bundle Manifest Signer

Signs a Bronze v0.1.3 evidence bundle manifest with Ed25519, producing a Silver Signed Bundle Assertion YAML.

```bash
python3 tools/silver/sign_bundle_manifest_v0_1_0.py demos/silver-demo-001 \
  --private-key demos/silver-demo-001/runtime/issuer-a/private-key.pem \
  --output demos/silver-demo-001/runtime/silver-signed-bundle-assertion-v0.1.0.yaml
```

The signature is over the raw bytes of the bundle manifest file. No YAML canonicalization is applied.

## Signed Assertion Verifier

Verifies a Silver Signed Bundle Assertion against a local trust policy.

```bash
python3 tools/silver/verify_signed_bundle_assertion_v0_1_0.py \
  demos/silver-demo-001/runtime/silver-signed-bundle-assertion-v0.1.0.yaml \
  demos/silver-demo-001/runtime/verifier-b/trust-policy.yaml \
  --silver-root demos/silver-demo-001 \
  --bronze-package-root demos/composed-bronze-demo-001 \
  --report demos/silver-demo-001/runtime/verification-report.json
```

The verifier checks:

1. Issuer and key_id are listed in the trust policy.
2. Signature algorithm is Ed25519.
3. Assertion has not expired.
4. Bundle manifest SHA-256 matches the recorded checksum.
5. Ed25519 signature over the bundle manifest raw bytes is valid.
6. Underlying v0.1.3 bundle manifest passes integrity verification.

Exit codes: 0 (pass), 1 (verification failed), 2 (usage error).

## Security Notes

- This is a demo signing system. Do not use generated keys for production.
- Private keys are runtime-only and must not be committed to version control.
- No revocation mechanism is provided in this version.
- This is Minimal Silver, not full Silver governance.
